visit(ast, {\n *       enter(node) {\n *         // enter any node\n *       },\n *       leave(node) {\n *         // leave any node\n *       }\n *     })\n *\n * 4) Parallel visitors for entering and leaving nodes of a specific kind.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       enter: {\n *         Kind(node) {\n *           // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *         }\n *       },\n *       leave: {\n *
